= Wiki Pages That Need Updates

Most of these are simple formatting updates (using the `{{code|...}}` template, for example).

== Phrasing

The first sentence of each function page should be an overview of that function, and it should read as though two words were implied at the beginning, "This function ..."

For example, the `abort()` function has a single sentence that says, "Is used to conditionally abort the execution of a macro."
That's properly constructed.

But the `and()` function says, "This function performs a logical *AND* comparison between all of the passed numeric values."
The First two words are redundant (additionally, and "of" should be removed from "all of the", but that's a separate issue).

I'm also thinking that the phrase "is used to" should be removed as well and active verbs used instead.  That changes `abort()` to, "Conditionally aborts the execution of a macro."  The `arg()` description would change from, "Is used to extract arguments that are passed to a macro when called as a user defined function." to "Extracts arguments that are passed to a macro when called as a user defined function."

It would be best to look at all such _phrasing_ issues before implementing any of them, or there could be a lot of redo involved!

== Fonts

I noticed that many pages are not consistent about how they format content.
For example, the `bitwiseand` page puts single quotes around `and` to denote that it's the boolean operation (and mistakenly says it's the logical operation!).
Instead of single quotes, I think a template should be defined for anything meant to be literal text, such as `{{lit|...}}`, and all literal text changed to use it.
Using a template allows the actual visual display to be changed at any time for all pages.

The same should be done for user input, variable names, code snippets, function parameters, and so forth.
A full list of all semantic types of string could be quite long.
This could be a huge benefit for accessibility since people with visual handicaps need consistency from their screen reader.

This is going to be a huge effort to revamp all existing pages. üôÅ

A good approach may be to gather a group of volunteers and give each one a portion of the wiki to clean up, starting with just the function pages.
For such volunteers to be helpful, that list of semantic types need to be prepared in advance.
