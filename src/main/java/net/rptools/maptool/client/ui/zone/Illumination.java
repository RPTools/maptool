/**
 * The main result type returned by an {@link Illuminator}.
 *
 * <p>At its core, this is a list of {@link LumensLevel} objects that provides a mechanical
 * description of the strength of light at each point. The areas are not disjoint, i.e., multiple
 * {@link LumensLevel}s can overlap with each other. Also, light and darkness are not subtracted
 * from each other.
 *
 * <p>From the basic structure, we are able to calculate a few derivative results:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>The obscured lumens levels. For each light area in the basic structure, subtract out any
 *       stronger darknesses, and for each darkness subtract out any stronger lights. The result is
 *       the obscured lit areas arranged by lumens level.
 *   <li>The complete lit area. This is the union of the light areas after the process in (1).
 *   <li>The disjoint obscured lumens levels. Starting from (1), we can additionally subtract strong
 *       light from weak light and strong darkness from weak darkness so that any given point is
 *       represented only in the strongest lumens level.
