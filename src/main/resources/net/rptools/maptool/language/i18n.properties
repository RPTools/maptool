# This is the English translation file for MapTool 1.3.  If you are
# translating MapTool to another language and leave out a translation
# for any key that appears here (the "key" is the text before the "=")
# then the values in this file will be used.
#
# Please submit all translations using the UTF-8 encoding!  If you MUST
# use a different encoding, please document it INSIDE your translation
# file.  I use an automated technique to detect the encoding and convert
# the file to the Unicode format that Java needs.  (For those who are
# interested, it involves the "native2ascii" program which is part of
# the Java Software Development Kit.)
#
# Some of the keys used in this file are not consistent. :(  For example,
# the NewMap menu option has the key "action.newMap" but the QuickMap
# menu option is "menu.QuickMap".  IMO this should be fixed, but MapTool
# 1.4 will likely have a completely different (i.e. consistent) set of
# keys, so we're not going to bother for 1.3.
#
# In all cases in this file, any accelerator keystroke will automatically
# have the 'menuShortcut' key added to it.  For Windows this is the Ctrl
# key, on the Mac it's the Command (Cmd) key.  Other platforms may have yet
# other keys.
#
# IMPORTANT: Do not add the platform-dependent menu modifier key to this
# file!  If you add "ctrl", for example, the modifier will be ignored
# on Windows but will require Mac users to use Cmd-Ctrl-C for a copy
# operation.  This is an ugly situation and we should find some way to
# define a menuShortcutKey (such as "menu") and then be able to use
# that in our definition strings.  I expect that MapTool 1.4 will have
# a user interface for changing these keystrokes so perhaps it's all
# moot anyway.
#
# Note that the accelerator keys are not case-sensitive.  So if you
# specify "F" as the accelerator, that means lowercase "F".  If you
# want an uppercase "F", add the word "shift":  "shift F" or "shift f".
# There are a lot of examples of this throughout the file.
#
# Check the javadoc for the 'MessageFormat' class for more details on
# the formatting of text in this file, as you'll see below (basically
# anything with braces):

# The only parameter for *most* translation strings is the

# strings, particularly the ones dealing with macro messages, have
# multiple parameters.  It's usually pretty obvious what type of
# value is being used as a parameter, but some messages have a comment
# directly above them to clarify, if appropriate.
#
# Valid patterns used to express parameters are:
#   {num}  replace the parameter with a string
#   {num,type,size}
#          type can be 'time' or 'date' (for java.util.Date objects),
#            'number' to indicate a numeric type,
#          and size can be
#            'short', 'int', or 'long' for numeric arguments of the same type.
#
# Check the javadoc for the 'MessageFormat' class for more details on the
# formatting of values in this file (the time and date ones are particularly
# tricky, but thankfully aren't used much in MapTool).  The URL is in the
# comments at the top of this file.

# Note the capitalization on the second one.  Some languages might use

# Note that these are not used universally, but as code is modified they
# will be added.  These should not be used by the programmer when user
# input is involved, for example in a dropdown box or similar.  That's
# because the program is likely hard-coded to look at the text instead
# of localizing it.  As we move forward, we'll write code so that it
# displays one thing but uses a separate value internally.  That allows
# you to display whatever you want to the user and still have hard-coded
# values in the program (because it makes the program significantly
# easier to write and faster at runtime).
