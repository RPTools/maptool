  <h2>Sight Properties</h2>
  <p>The sight properties define how a token can see</p>
  <h3>Name</h3>
  <p>This is the name of the light source</p>
  <h3>Shape</h3>
  <p>
    The shape of the vision, this can be one of
    <ul>
      <li>Circle</li>
      <li>Cone</li>
      <li>Square</li>
      <li>Grid</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h3>Distance</h3>
  <p>The distance that the vision extends to, if this is 0 then it uses the vision distance from
  the map.</p>
  <h3>From Edge of Token</h3>
  <p>If this is checked then the distance is measured from the edge of the token, otherwise it
    is measured from the center of the token.</p>
  <h3>Arc</h3>
  <p>Specifies how large the field of vision should be for conical vision (in Degrees).</p>
  <h3>Offset</h3>
  <p>Specifies how many degrees offset conical vision should be from the tokens facing.</p>
  <h3>Light Source Multiplier</h3>
  <p>The multiplier value to add to light sources when using this vision type. For example if a
     low light vision doubled the distance of light source then this value would be 2.</p>
  </p>

  <h2>Personal Lights</h2>
  <p>As well as the main sight properties you can define personal light sources that tokens with
  this vision have. A personal light is only "seen" by the token in question. Personal light
    sources can be used for things like
    <ul>
      <li>Darkvision where the token does not need any "normal" light source to see</li>
      <li>Light sources that only the token can see</li>
      <li>To handle any rules such as a player can always determine what is 5' away via
        sight/touch</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A token can never see the personal light source of another token even if they are using the
    same vision type.</p>
  </p>
<h3>Personal Light Distance</h3>
<p>The distance that the personal light source for the token extends.</p>
<h3>Personal Light Color</h3>
<p>The color of the personal light source for the token.</p>
<h3>Personal Light Lumens</h3>
<p>The lumens value for the personal light source. The lumens determine the strength of the
  light source and are compared against lights with a negative value (darkness) to determine if
  they light up the darkness or not. Seet the light tab for more information about lumens</p>
