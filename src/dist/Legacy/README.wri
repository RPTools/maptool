~~~~~~~~~~~~ ReadMe for RPTools.net family of RPG tools ~~~~~~~~~~~~

This document contains the following sections:

 * Overview
 * List of tools in the RPTools series
 * Requirements for running the tools
 * Executing the tools
 * Troubleshooting common problems

Documentation for the various tools can be found at the link below.
However, as the tools develop and change rapidly it's likely that the
forum users will have the scoop on the most current tweaks and features.
   http://www.rptools.net/?page=faq

When reporting problems on the forum, please include the output of the
tool called "SysInfo" which is linked to from this page:
   http://www.rptools.net/?page=troubleshooting
Note that MapTool has this tool built-in as the "Help > Gather System Info"
menu option (and the getInfo("debug") macro command).

Also be sure to watch the screencasts that demonstrate the various
features of MapTool.  One of our forum users put together little
snippets of video that describe various things that new users will need
to know.  They are broken up into topics and organized by GM and Player,
so you only need to view the ones that apply to you.  Visit our main
site and click on the "Tutorials" link in the toolbar.

Welcome to RPTools!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RPTools provides the following programs to enhance your gaming
experience.  All of these are written in Java and are therefore
portable, running on Windows, OS X, and Unix/Linux.

 * DiceTool - Feature-rich dice-rolling application.
 * MapTool - Virtual tabletop application.
 * InitTool - Combat initiative manager
 * TokenTool - Gaming token creation tool.
 * CharTool - Character tracking tool.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

			    <<< Requirements >>>

All of the RPTools.net applications are programmed in Java and can
be used on any platform supporting Java 6 or Java 7.  Specifics on
where to find Java for your platform are provided on the main web
site at http://www.rptools.net/

Please note that some third-party libraries used by MapTool don't work
100% with Java 7.  We are in the process of finding these pieces and
updating or replacing them.  In the mean time, errors can be reported to
us as described below.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

			<<< Starting & Using the Tools >>>

All of the tools can be started using the Java Web Start technology
from the links on the RPTools downloads page at:
   http://www.rptools.net/?page=launch

The Web Start technique is completely self-contained.  Full instructions
are given on the page linked above.

Alternatively you can download the zip archive (Windows, OS X, Unix/Linux)
and DMG file (Mac OS X) from here:
   http://www.rptools.net/?page=download

Visit the above link for details on executing the tools; a summary
is provided here.  ZIP files are discussed first, then the DMG.

			<<< ZIP Archive >>>

Extract the zip archive to a folder of your choosing.  Be sure to
preserve directories, since some of our tools expect to find their
code in the "lib" subdirectory.  In the folder where you extract
the archive will be a system-specific start program:

    Windows:	MapToolLauncher.exe
    OS X:	Launch MapTool.command
    Linux/Unix:	Launch MapTool.sh

On all Unix-based systems (OS X, Linux, Unix) you may need to add
execute permission to the file listed above if your zip utility did
not already set that permission for you.  Use your operating system
tools to make this change (Google for "change permissions" if you
need help).

If you don't see a start program like those above, then you're system
doesn't need one.  Simply execute the JAR file you see in the directory
and the application will start.

			<<< DMG Disk Image >>>

This file is a disk image that can be installed easily on OS X.  Mac
users may download the file and double-click to begin installation.
After the disk image opens, drag the application to your desktop (or
wherever you want the application kept).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

			<<< Troubleshooting >>>
		<<< Troubleshooting Download Version >>>

PROGRAM FAILS TO START:  If your system-specific file (above) fails
to start the application, verify that you have a Java Runtime
Environment installed.  From a command prompt, type "java -version"
(without the quotes) and press <Enter>. The Java version should be
printed to the command prompt.  If you receive an error message,
download and install the appropriate Java package for your operating
system as described at the above URLs.

MAP DOESN'T LOAD [MapTool only]:  Some larger maps may require more
memory to initially load than the default Java Runtime Environment
allocates.  Check the folder where you extracted the zip archive.
As described above, each operating system has its own start file.
For Windows, the EXE will ask for memory size parameters -- try
increasing the maximum memory and running MapTool again (you can
always delete or edit the text file 'mt.cfg' to change previous
settings).  For OS X and Linux/Unix users, edit the corresponding
script and modify the memory settings at the top of the file (if
you're using a script).

Mac Users:  If you installed from the DMG file, look inside the
resulting app package for a file named "Info.plist" and edit it with a
text editor.  Search for "VMOptions" and the line immediately
below it will have the memory settings.  The "-Xss" option sets the
stack size, the "-Xms" option sets the starting/minimum memory
size, and the "-Xmx" option sets the maximum memory size.

Our wiki has more information:  https://wiki.rptools.info/index.php/Stack_Size

			<<< Troubleshooting >>>
		<<< Troubleshooting WebStart Version >>>

The Java Web Start feature will download the appropriate files from
the RPTools web site and save them on your computer before executing
the program.  You will be prompted to allow this to happen.  Once
complete, the program will begin execution (you may be prompted for
this to be allowed as well).  If you right-click on the Java Web
Start link and save the downloaded Java Web Start file on your
desktop, you can double-click it at any time in the future to execute
the program from the copy saved on your system -- you won't need
an Internet connection in the future.  (In fact, you can send the
JNLP file to other players and they can double-click it as well!
Just remember that the first time you run a particular version, you
need an Internet connection in order to download the files for that
version.)

		<<< Troubleshooting Other Problems >>>

MAPTOOL NETWORKING PROBLEM:  Networking is a big topic, so please
visit our forum (link below) and check out the Networking FAQ in
the MapTool -> HowTo subforum.  There you will find a document that
describes what MapTool needs in order to work properly along with
a step-by-step approach for diagnosing your networking problems.
Solutions for common problems is included in the NFAQ.

MapTool creates a log of errors in the ".maptool" folder under your
home directory.  Also in there will be a bunch of subfolders that
are used by MapTool internally to keep track of maps and other
images.  If your problem is repeatable, i.e. can be reproduced over
and over again, please remove the existing log file and then reproduce
the error.  Then zip up the log file and attach it to a post in the
MapTool forum.

For Windows users you may want to periodically execute the "Backup"
batch file in the top-level MapTool directory.  It will copy MapTool
registry entries into a file named "mtsave.reg".  Java saves
application preferences and global macros in the registry so this
batch file is necessary if you want an easy way to back up those
entries so they can be restored in case of a hard drive replacement or
similar change.  Similarly, you can run the "Remove" script to delete
all registry entries created by MapTool.

Last, MapTool uses a third-party library known as TinyLAF (for Tiny Look
And Feel) for rendering all of the standard graphics such as buttons,
toolbars, progress bars, text fields, and so on.  If you would like to
try out different themes for MapTool, visit the following URL:
http://www.muntjak.de/hans/java/tinylaf/index.html  There you will find
a binary distribution of TinyLAF that includes the "control panel"
application that allows interactive editing of the theme.  It will be in
a library called "tinycp.jar" and you will execute it by either
double-clicking on it (in most GUIs) or running "java -jar tinycp.jar"
from the command line.

For any other issues, please come to http://forums.RPTools.net/ and
check the forums.  In particular, use the error message as a search
string to see if your question has been asked and answered previously.
If not, post a message there describing the difficulties you are having.
Most problems can be addressed quickly by one of the many helpful
forum members or one of our team members.
