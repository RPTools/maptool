# Welcome to RPTools!

The [RPTools](http://www.rptools.net/) family of RPG software
products includes five applications.  Our goal is provide software
that helps you enjoy interactive gaming with humans.

Many of us grew up playing various games.  It might be *Monopoly*
or *Risk*, maybe *Pictionary* or *Trivial Pursuit*, or perhaps
a role-playing game like *Dungeons and Dragons* or *Traveller*.
But as we got older our friends left the area and the games we played to
socialize and entertain ourselves fell by the wayside as we got caught
up in the rat race.

No more!  We have software that will help you bring back those long-ago
friendships and start having fun again!  A quick overview of all five
applications appears below, but the rest of the document is focused on
the one you've just downloaded:  **MapTool**.

## Overview of RPTools Applications

#. **MapTool** - virtual tabletop gaming application

	**MapTool** is an online, multiplayer, programmable, interactive, and
cross-platform application that allows collaborative gaming such as
role-playing games, boardgames, card games, dice games, and much more.

	It has been translated into many languages and new translations are
submitted by our users all the time.  As of this writing the
included languages are English (the primary one), Spanish, French,
German, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Russian, and Chinese.

#. **TokenTool** - digital gaming token creation tool

	**TokenTool** is a simple graphical program for creating "tokens",
digital versions of miniatures that can be used with **MapTool**
or any other virtual tabletop application, such as **Roll20** and
**d20Pro**.

#. **CharacterTool** - character management tool

	**CharTool** is a character management tool.  It will manage all
aspects of character creation and advancement for those game systems
which have a template available.  Seasoned users can create their own
templates to add to the available game systems or create their
own unique system.

#. **InitiativeTool** - initiative tracker (mostly for combat encounters)

	**InitTool** will manage the turn-by-turn sequencing that many
game systems use.  Characters can be created in **CharTool** and
dragged into **InitTool** when needed.

#. **DiceTool** - feature-rich dice-rolling application

	**DiceTool** is a (not so) simple dice rolling application.  Users can
develop their own custom dice rolling functions and implement any dice
rolling scheme they can think up!  **DiceTool** comes preloaded with a
variety of game systems already implemented.

## Where to find more information

One of our forum users, **brad**, has put together a series of a
dozen or so short screencast videos.  They are categorized first
by who is most likely to use them, players or the game master.  A
second level of categorization involves functionality:  what do you
want to do?  The videos are generally short, none are more than 8-9
minutes, and all are narrated so that each part of the graphical
interface is explained.  You can find them on the
[Tutorials](http://www.rptools.net/tutorials/) page on our
main web site.

We suggest you start on the [FAQ](http://www.rptools.net/faq/)
page of our web site for basic questions.  For more involved questions
you may want to register on [our forums](http://forums.rptools.net/)
where you can search for others who have experienced the problem (and
likely find your solution) or start a new thread with your own question.
(Please do search though, as it helps us keep the forums from having
many repetitive threads on the same topic!)

If you choose to ask your question on our forum, please include the
output generated when you use the **Help > Gather System Info...**
option from the **MapTool** menu.  There is information there that is
important in helping us diagnose the problem you're having.  (Some
people like to redact portions of the output.  Just be aware that we
only include important parts and removing portions of it might mean you
won't get your problem solved.)

## Requirements

All of the RPTools applications are programmed in Java and can be used
on any platform supporting Java 6 or later, although we are rapidly
moving towards requiring Java 8.  Specifics on where to find
Java for your platform are available at
[Oracle's website](http://www.java.com/).  We strongly recommend that
you use 64-bit Java on 64-bit operating systems and 32-bit Java on
32-bit operating systems.

**MapTool** requires at least 256MB of memory for itself.  This number is
NOT the amount of physical memory in the machine, but is the amount of
memory needed just by this application.  Larger memory sizes will allow
for larger, more intricate maps.

Because Java was initially developed for standalone applications,
it requires that upper and lower memory limits be set when Java
applications are executed.  We have provided a graphical configuration
tool to help with this called **MapTool Launcher**, or just **MTL**
for short.  A full description of how to choose memory settings is
beyond the scope of this document, but you can find more information
on our forums in the [MapTool](http://forums.rptools.net/viewforum.php?f=3)
category.

## Starting the application

#. Download the Application

	You can visit the
[Downloads page](http://www.rptools.net/?page=downloads)
and download the ZIP file for your platform (Windows, OS X, or Linux).
(Stay away from ones marked B<broken>.  Those
were released and then later found to have one or more issues that
make them unsuitable for most users.)

#. Unpack the ZIP file somewhere on your computer

	Do not try to run the application from inside the ZIP file
because it won't work!

	When you extract the contents be sure to
extract full directory names.  Some files stored in the archive are
in subdirectories and the application won't work correctly unless
that structure is preserved.

#. Execute the application

	Once unpacked, you can navigate to that folder (a.k.a. "directory")
and double-click the **MapTool Launcher** file to start it.  It has a
filename extension of **.jar** (it's a Java archive).

	The **MapTool Launcher** has its own documentation.  Look in
the *doc* subdirectory for the *HowTo* guide.

## Using the Application

The best place to find information on **MapTool** is our web site.
Start at the [Tutorial page](http://rptools.net/tutorials/) and
check out the screencasts created by one of our forum users.  They
are very helpful!  Try out the things you see in the screencast
while the video is playing and don't be afraid to pause the video
or rewind it.  The author moves at a pretty good clip because he
knows you can pause!

You'll also find [our forums](http://forums.rptools.net/) to be an
excellent place to ask questions and receive answers.  We have a very
large community of people willing to share their experiences on
technical issues as well as big picture questions regarding how to use
**MapTool**.

## Summary

That's it!  Thank you for joining us at **RPTools** and we hope
you have a successful foray into the world of online virtual gaming!
