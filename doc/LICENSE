Licensing Overview

The original version of some pieces of this application were covered by
the Apache Software License (Version 2.0) as described below.

Revisions to this code (application and libraries) as made by the
RPTools.net team are licensed differently, using the Affero GPL v3
for the application and LGPL v3 for libraries.  These licenses are
"upward compatible" (since the Apache license has no restrictions
and the GPL/LGPL only adds compatible requirements).  This license
simply states that if someone distributes binaries created from
this source code, they must make the source code itself (with their
modifications) available.  See the detailed text, below.

The Apache license requires credit where credit is due, so each
library has a "readme" file that is part of the source distribution
(and is included in the deployment packages) specifying the details
for the relevant library.

The original RPTools team felt that the "forced redistribution of
source code" was too onerous, but in this day of ubiquitous high
speed Internet connections, free web site hosting, and free source
code repositories for open source projects, this hardly seems the
case any more.  Thus, with the blessing of the original RPTools
members the license going forward will be Affero GPL v3 for all
application code and LGPL v3 for all libraries.  If you are interested
in obtaining the source code yourself, please visit our GitHub page
at https://github.com/RPTools/ for more information on our team's
current software projects.

Included herein are summaries of each license; see the specified readme
file for a particular library for details.
