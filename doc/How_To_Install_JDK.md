How to Install Java Development Kit (JDK)
=======================

You may not have a software development kits, which you will need if you want to do any coding. You may also want to install multiple versions of Java. If you run old versions of Maptool you will have Java 6. For Maptool 1.4 you will need Java 7 (1.7) and possibly Java 8. If you haven't already, lets install both!

**Note:** At this stage you need to know if your PC is 64bit or 32bit. If you are not sure:

1. open `Windows Explorer`
2. right click on `Computer`
3. select `Properties`

This opens the Control Panel Homes Page about your PC and in the "System" section against the "System Type" it will say either "32-bit Operating System" or 64.

Install latest Java SE Development Kit 7
----------------------------------------

1. Go to the Java 7 Downloads Page
2. Click the "Accept License Agreement" radio button
3. Download the "Windows x64" (for 64bit Windows) or "Windows x86" (for 32 bit) Java SE Development Kit. At the time of writing the 64bit file is `jdk-7u75-windows-x64.exe`
4. Run the installer file you have just downloaded. This will try and install to a directory like: `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.75`, which is fine. If the directory says JRE instead of JDK then you have downloaded the wrong file. Don't worry if you have both, the JDK contains a JRE.
