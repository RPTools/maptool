This directory contains all licenses used by various RPTools packages.

The libraries use LGPLv3, the applications use the Affero license,
and there may be some older pieces of code that use GPLv3 but those
will be transitioned to one of the first two over time.

The plan was to include this directory in the Git repository of all
RPTools packages so that the Gradle build file could refer to them
as needed and, perhaps, in an automated manner.  In other words, a
single 'build.gradle' for all RPTools packages that automatically
distinguishes between the repo being for a library or an application
and "doing the Right Thing".

Another alternative is to copy the appropriate license file to
another filename, and use the package name as the filename.  So the
COPYING.AFFERO could be copied to LICENSE.maptool, for example.
Then the build.gradle could refer to "LICENSE"+project.name without
any need for conditional logic.

Which of those techniques -- or any other future possibility --
will be decided over time, likely after trying one or more to see
how they work out. :)
