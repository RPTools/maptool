Maptool 1.6.0
=====
Lots of enhancements, bug fixes and improvements to the code base.

**Some Highlights**
- New dialog and frame functions support HTML5, JavaScript and CSS.
- Token VBL Simplification - Generating VBL for large, complex tokens like maps is much faster and producers much tighter VBL that is less demanding.  Also allows for automatic generation via the `setTokenVBL()` macro function.
- Movement Blocking Layer - Now you can make those Force Fields that would block movement but not sight.
- Look & Feel themes can now be selected from the Themes menu.  More enhancements to come.
- Pre-defined Campaign Property sets can now be selected and loaded in the Campaign Properties dialog.
- New Marker assets added to Default in the Resource Library - Use Restore Default Images in the Help menu to get them.
- The annoying behavior where browsing for a drawing texture would cause the Resource Library to also change folders has been fixed!

This release focused on clearing out bugs both old and new.

**Highlights**
- Bug fixes. Some serious and some just quality of life.
- More translation updates.
- Brought the various libraries used by MapTool up to current releases.
- Shout out to Melek and other volunteers for their work on 20+ new and improved wiki pages .

Enhancements
-----
- [#753][i753] Reserved variable names `init.current` and `init.round` are now highlighted in macro editor and documented on wiki.
- [#359][i359] Added infomation from `getInfo("server")` and `getInfo("campaign")` to the Sentry error logging.

Bug Fixes
-----
- [#1024][i1024] Macro function `execFunction()` would choke on apostrophes. Fixed.

-----
* [#617][i617] - Using the right-click Arrange -> Send to Back/Bring to Front functions could undo recent token changes. Fixed.
* [#603][i603] - Attempting to import a campaign file as campaign properties was throwing ClassCastException. Now displays a proper error message.
* [#594][i594] - Dragging tokens on hex grids did not display the blue path line and move count was slightly outside of the hex cell.  Fixed.
* [#589][i589] - Title option for dialog() command only worked on first use.  Subsequent uses did not update the dialog title. Fixed.
* [#587][i587] - Using title option in frame() would keep the frame from being reopened again once closed. Fixed.
* [#585][i585] - The _temporary_ property of frames was not being obeyed.  Fixed.
* [#584][i584] - New functions for getting Frame/Dialog properties.

  * functions no longer send entire token object on change to clients
* [#573][i573] - MapTool credits in Help -> About window updated.
* [#569][i569] - Documented undocumented parameters of getPropertyDefault and setLayer.  Fixed NPE caused when getPropertyDefault is given only one parameter and there is no current token.
  * getPropertyDefault() - Accepts second parameter for Token (Property) Type and returns the default for that type.
  * setLayer() - A third parameter, forceShape, forces tokens to be of type Top Down if moved to Object layer and to either Circle or Square for the token layer.
* [#563][i563] - Additional parameter map name added to getState, setState, and setAllStates macro functions.
* [#560][i560] - Corrected error message if setZoom() was passed argument.
* [#558][i558] - Popup notes for Hidden/Object tokens did not include the GM name if only player notes field had content and if only the GM notes had content no name was shown.  Fixed.
* [#555][i555] - A number of macro functions that set properties on tokens have been updated to use new internal server commands to only pass the relevant data from server to client instead of the entire token object.
  * Functions:  bringToFront, moveToken, removeTokenFacing, resetProperty, resetSize, sendToBack, setAllStates, setGMNotes, setLayer, setLibProperty, setNotes, setNPC, setOwnedByAll, setOwner, setPC, setProperty, setPropertyType, setSize, setState, setTokenDrawOrder, setTokenFacing, setTokenHeight, setTokenShape, setTokenSnapToGrid, setTokenWidth
* [#552][i552] - A number of macro functions were only making changes to tokens locally and not pushing them out to the other clients.  Fixed.  See also #555.
  * Functions Affected:  setGMNotes, setNotes, setTokenShape, setTokenWidth, setTokenHeight, setTokenSnapToGrid, resetSize
* [#551][i551] - Opening and closing the Edit Token dialog on a Player Client was enabling Visible of FoW even though players did not have access to the setting.  Fixed.
* [#549][i549] - A number of macro functions were internally calling both Zone.putToken() as well as ServerCommand.putToken() which resulted in the token being sent out to clients twice. Fixed.
  * Functions Affected:  setTokenImage, setTokenPortrait, setTokenHandout and setTokenOpacity
* [#547][i547] - Map name added as optional parameter to getName() and setName() functions.

  * Undo buffers are specific to each client. Undo/Redos only affect the client taking action.
* [#150][i150] - Using sendToBack() and bringToFront() macros could break states or bars on tokens.  Fixed(in 1.5.0).
* [#132][i132] - Calling getname() (lower case 'n') was falling through to setName and returned incorrect error message. Fixed with other changes to token macro functions.
* [#116][i116] - strPropFromVars function was creating an extra, empty entry.  Fixed.  Second parameter made optional and defaults to "UNSUFFIXED".

MapTool 1.5.0
=====
A major update pulling in almost a years worth of enhancements and bug fixes from the Nerps fork back to the main MapTool repository. This will bring us back to a single build for users once again while we continue working on MapTool 2.0.

___

Bug Fixes
-----
* [#113][i113] - *Macro function getMoveCount() does not return terrain modifier costs*. See issue for full details but basically a new parameter is added so getMoveCount(0, 1) will return movement costs taking into account any Terrain Modifiers.
* [#108][i108] - *Fix setTokenOpacity to update token for players.*. Token is now updated with opacity effect on the server after setTokenOpacity macro calls.
* [#92][i92] - *MapTool should default to UTF-8 encoding*. Windows likes to default to it's one file encoding which can cause issues in macros and certain encoded characters. MapTool will now always launch using UTF-8 file encoding! I've also added a 'Encoding Information' section in Gather Debug Info under the help menu to verify what encoding you are using.
* [#80][i80] - *Comparison method violates its general contract in FogUtil.calculateVisibility(FogUtil.java:81)*. This should be fixed now.
* [#81][i81] - *Cell Highlight distance text not sizing for grid sizes*. This is now fixed
* [#76][i76] - Will no longer see errors when attempting to open initiative window on Linux or MacOS.
* [#68][i68] - MapTool's i18n language override enabled via Edit -> Preferences -> Startup tab. This will override your default language set by your OS.
* [#41][i41] - Allow player owned tokens without "sight" to move within currently exposed FoW, e.g. areas other PC token can currently see. Hopefully this is finally squashed properly...
* [#44][i44] - If running the JAR version with your own JRE installed, Edit -> Preferences will no longer throw and error and blow up! Instead the Startup tab will be grayed out (as those values will not be used and you must make your own startup script to set memory settings when using the JAR format)
* [#27][i27] - Code cleanup, .pdf & .por files will no longer throw errors to the log file.
* [#65][i65] - Gradle will once again build and deploy vs throw an error getting the branch name.
* [#179][i179] - Pulled in @Jaggeroth change from main RPTool's Repo; ZOrder sort violation problem by restoring the original comparator and only using the new figure comparator when sorting figure only.
* [#54][i54]  - Missing Preferences menu option on OS X
* [#59][i59]  - App does not check for new versions in 1.4.4.1
* [#5][i5]  - Adding new state causes java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException no more!
* [#6][i6]  - Fixed various Typos
* [#15][i15] - Lighting wasn't immediately forced to connected clients and should be fixed now.
* [#18][i18] - Exporting Campaigns back to 1.4.0.1 was failing due to new objects added. You can now export any campaign back to 1.4.0.1 but as always, this is permanent in that it will strip out new objects as in TokenVBl, new lighting options, etc but macros will not be touched and may fail if they contain new macro functions not available in 1.4.0.1.
* [#19][i19] - Default save location for tokens are now remembered!
* [#20][i20] - Added missing documentation for lights/vision, e.g. 'scale'
* [#21][i21] - Lights are not updating properly based on ownership looked like it was tied to other 'light' bugs and should now be fixed.
* [#23][i23] - Fixed sendToBack & bringToFront macros broke states and bar changes in the macro. This was an OLD one going back to 1.3b63! You can now safely use these functions in your macro now!
* [#30][i30] - Players see NPC movement when there are no lights no more! This was another old bug going back to 1.3b-something and only showed itself if you had NO lights (including personal lights, aka darkvision).
* [#232][i232] - Mouse pointer incorrectly changing to Hand pointer was an oversight which has been corrected, hands down the best bug fix!
* [#210][i210] - *Non-snap-to-grid Tokens have bad last path info* Tokens now walk the straight and narrow again, no more drunken paths shown.

Enhancements
-----
* [#125][i125] - When entering invalid JVM values in Startup Preferences, a dialog will not display explaining why it was not saved. Another dialog will show if any JVM values were changed warning the user that invalid options could prevent MapTool from starting and to confirm changes.
* [#77][i77] - Tweaked the A* algorithm for a more natural and straighter move though open spaces for both square and hex grids. Also tweaked the A* algorithm to find the shortest path more consistently.
* [#49][i49] - Pathfinding! When activated (via new 'AI' toggle button), tokens will find the shortest path to it's destination as you drag them on the token or hidden layers, taking VBL into account. Yes, this means your tokens will no longer walk thru VBL! If no path can be found (or found within several seconds) no path will be shown, however you can still move your token to that location. This can happen because the area is blocked off or you are working with a very complicated or large map. With MapTool allowing unbounded/nearly infinite map space, I had to include a timeout to prevent an infinite search.
A new token config value is also now available called Terrain Modifier. This multiplies the cost of moving into that tokens cell and taken into account with Pathfinding is used. Some examples are:
Setting the multiplier to 2 will cost 10 feet of movement vs 5 feet acting like difficult terrain.
Setting the multiplier to a sufficiently high number, like 99999, will effectively block the movement and make the token go around the obstacle. Useful for things like an arrow slit, window, lava, etc.
Any token can have this modifier, NPC tokens to make PC tokens go around them vs through them, or stamp tokens on the object layer like oil or water. You could also place tokens on the hidden layer over rocky terrain to denote difficult terrain.
Please note, at this time no macros are available to access these new feature, nor server options to force players to use this mode of moving tokens. Due to the complexity of this feature, I felt it better to get this out to you, the user, to play with and use (or not use) and provide feedback. Therefore the Terrain Modifier *could* change in the future or expand in functionality. There could be performance related hits as well, although I did my best to mitigate this, as well as you can turn this feature off and revert to basic movement.
Also note, currently fractional modifiers are not supported at this time nor straight addition modifiers. I plan to expand this functionality over time.
* [#45][i45] - Lighting has been improved to greatly reduce lag when multiple light sources are on a map. It also helps alleviate the slowness you encounter as you reveal more and more FoW.
* [#63][i63] - Spacebar functionality has been restored to it's original behavior, including ctrl+spacebar & shift+spacebar.
A new shift+ctrl+spacebar command along with a new pointer image is now available. When this keystroke combo is pressed, and you are a GM, the pointer will center & zoom all connected clients to that point. When it is released, all clients will return to their previous view point & zoom.
* [#67][i67] - A new vision/light type of GRID has also been added, which is a circle of the specified size but only lights up the affected grid cells within range, much like using the template tool. This is useful in systems like Pathfinder if you want to see exactly which grid cells (squares) are affected by a Light/Aura or can be seen. Aura for Channel Energy for instance, or seeing which grid cells are in dim light for concealment.
* [#71][i71] - The default data directory (USER_HOME/.maptool-{Vendor}, so for Nerps fork, .maptool-Nerps) can now be overridden in Edit -> Preferences -> Startup tab.
* [#43][i43] - Spotless and .appveyor.yml updated. This is purely a build process enhancement to make deployment of the releases better.
* [#66][i66] - Update packaged JRE to Java 10 and verify MapTool runs under Java 10. *Note: Java 9 was a short term release hence the update to Java 10.
* [#8][i8]  - New packaging mechanism! OS specific "installs" are now being generated using Oracles native javapackager tool. It packages the JAR, native executable, and JRE in the following packages: .exe (Windows), .dmg & .pkg (MacOS), & .deb (Linux) as well as unified JAR that can be run manually.
* [#26][i26] - MapTool now checks and alerts user when a new version is available as a GitHub release and allow you to download it! You can "skip" a version to stop alerting until the next release comes out or cancel all auto update checks. It will download the release based on your OS (.exe, .pkg, or .deb)
* [#9][i9]  - New macro function added to change token ownership to 'Owned by All', setOwnedByAll(boolean [,tokenID]) returns boolean
* [#22][i22] - Darkvision changed to Darkvision: circle r60 (removed distance=62.5)
* [#25][i25] - Cone lights now accept 'offset=x' as an option just like vision
* [#33][i33] - Java stack traces are sent automatically to Sentry.io for aggregation and notification. No private info is gathered or sent. This lets me know if an unreported bug shows up and how critical may be so I can get it fixed quicker and with minimal info needed from users.
* New RESTful functions getRequest & postRequest to send GET & POST requests to a URI. *Note: You must first turn access on in Preferences for these macro functions to work.
* New function exportData exportData(FilePath file, String data, boolean appendToFile) which saves string data to external file.
* New function getEnvironmentVariable(String name), Returns the value stored in the Environment Variable.
* New menu option added to the "Connections" window. Right clicking a player will offer a "Whisper" command that prepopulates the chat window with a whisper macro.
* [#237][i237] - Added support to use shift-enter to insert newlines into the command entry box (also known as the chat entry box)
* [#239][i239] - MapToolScriptTokenMaker now handles function names with . notation and dynamically pulls in all functions names. TokenMakerMaker no longer needs to be ran upon changes to MTScript.
* [#240][i240] - Macro Editor now has Auto-Completion for macro functions! A brief description and summary can be displayed (these will be added as time permits)
* [#332][i332] - Allow to set color for personal lights in campaign Sight types
* [#324][i324] - fix output of getViewArea. This might break existing macro using workaround to interpret the broken result before the fix.
* [#326][i326] - defineFunction with open edit window
* [#365][i365] - Support wrap and syntax in property editor
