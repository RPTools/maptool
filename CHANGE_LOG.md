## Enhancements & Features
- [#3010][i3010] Attempting to access lib:token content via URI will produce an error message if the lib:token doesn't have URI access enabled.
- [#3006][i3006] WebRTC support added. Checkbox added to Start Server dialog. Can only be used when connecting through RPTools.net server list.
- [#2994][i2994] Reserved namespaces added to avoid future conflicts: 
  - `.`, `_`, `builtin`, `builtin.`, `internal`, `internal.`, `maptool`, `maptool.`, `maptools`, `maptools.`, `net.rptools.`, `rptools`, `rptools.`, `standard`, `standard.`, `tokentool.`

- [#2964][i2964] New macro functions for Dialogs/Frames/overlays allow retrieving the content directly from lib:tokens with a URI. They otherwise function as the previous versions.
  - `html.dialog(name, liburi [, options ])`
  - `html.dialog5(name, liburi [, options ])`
  - `html.frame(name, liburi [, options ])`
  - `html.frame5(name, liburi [, options ])`
  - `html.overlay(name, liburi [, options ])`
- [#2963][i2963] Support for accessing CSS/JS/HTML from Lib:Tokens via URI in Dialog/Frame/Overlays added.
  - `lib://<tokename>/macro/<macro name>`
  - `lib://<tokename>/property/<property name>`
- [#2961][i2961] Support JavaScript UDFs via `MTScript.createFunction(funcName, jsFunction)`.
- [#2960][i2960] New macro support for multiple Graalvm JavaScript scopes (namespaces).
- [#2943][i2943] Experimental WebRTC supported for connecting to servers without port-forwarding.
- [#2919][i2919] Loading GIF anims from tokens or tables into Frame5 windows and Overlays now working. Only first frame loads with old Frame() windows.
- [#2915][i2915] Public/private key support for player login.

- [#2879][i2879] New macro functions to get/set the flipped status of a token.
  - `flipTokenX()`, `flipTokenY()`, `flipTokenIso()`, `isFlippedX()`, `isFlippedY()`, `isFlippedIso()`
- [#2775][i2775] New macro function `getMapName()` to returns the GM Name from the Display Name.
- [#2774][i2774] MapTool no longer prompts to *Save Campaign* when no changes have been made.

- [#2519][i2519] JavaScript support moved to GraalVM-JS and previous functionality of `js.eval()` restored.
