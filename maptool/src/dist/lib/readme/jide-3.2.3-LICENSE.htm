<B>IMPORTANT - READ CAREFULLY: This JIDE Software, Inc. (&quot;JIDE&quot;) Software 
License Agreement (&quot;SLA&quot;) is a legal agreement between you (an individual 
developer of software applications) and JIDE for the JIDE software product 
accompanying this SLA, which includes computer software and may include 
associated source code, media, printed materials, and &quot;on-line&quot; or electronic 
documentation (&quot;SOFTWARE PRODUCT&quot;). By installing, copying, or otherwise using 
the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, you agree to be bound by the terms of this SLA. If you do 
not agree to the terms of this SLA, do not install, use, distribute in any 
manner, or replicate in any manner, any part, file or portion of the SOFTWARE 
PRODUCT. </B>
    </p>
<HR align="justify">

<P align="justify">The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is protected by copyright laws and international
copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties.
The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is licensed, not sold.
<OL type=1>
  <LI>
  <p align="justify"><B>RIGOROUS ENFORCEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.</B> If the
  licensed right of use for this SOFTWARE PRODUCT is purchased by you with any
  intent to reverse engineer, decompile, create derivative works, and the
  exploitation or unauthorized transfer of, any JIDE intellectual property
  and trade secrets, to include any exposed methods or source code where
  provided, no licensed right of use shall exist, and any products created as a
  result shall be judged illegal by definition of all applicable law. Any sale
  or resale of intellectual property or created derivatives so obtained will be
  prosecuted to the fullest extent of all local, federal and international law.
  <LI>
  <p align="justify"><B>GRANT OF LICENSE.</B> This SLA, if legally executed as defined herein,
  licenses and so grants you the following rights:
  <ol>
    <LI>
    <p align="justify"><B>Single Developer License.</B> Single Developer License allows an individual developer to use APIs (&quot;Application Programming Interface&quot;) provided by SOFTWARE PRODUCT in any number of projects that he or she is working on. A Single Developer License for the SOFTWARE PRODUCT may not be shared or used by more than one individual developer. In a project that uses the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, each individual developer on the project requires a separate Single Developer License as long as they need to access JIDE API. .
    <LI>
    <p align="justify"><b>Deployment License</b>. If either case below is true, in addition to 
    the developer licenses you purchased, you need to purchase deployment 
    licenses.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <ol type="I">
      <li type="i">
      <p align="justify">You exposed the API (application program interface) 
      provided by JIDE to your end users. That is your end user will use our 
      APIs directly to create application through the purchase of your product 
      which includes JIDE.</li>
      <li type="i">
      <p align="justify">The number of your application deployments is larger 
      than 1000 times of the number of developer licenses you purchased. And you 
      are not willing to show JIDE name and/or logo in about dialog, or splash 
      screen or any other 
      places where users can easily notice.</li>
    </ol>
  </ol>
  <ol>
    <LI value="3">
    <p align="justify"><b>Source Code License</b>. In addition to the license and 
    rights granted above, JIDE grants you the right to use and modify the JIDE 
    source provided you licensed source code. Different from developer license, 
    source code license is licensed to a team. Each team only needs to 
    purchase one copy of source code license and share it among those developers who have their own Single Developer License.

      derivative works contain copyrightable code or expression derived from the 
      JIDE source code; provided, however, that JIDE grants to you a fully-paid, 
      royalty free license, to use copy and modify such updates, modifications,

      developers in your project who plan to access  JIDE source code signing 
      on the source code license. As long as they signed, they become registered 
      developers. An alternative to this is to let a 
      delegate signs source code license as an organization. The delegate will 
      be responsible for letting other developers who plan to access the source 
      code reviewing this license agreement first before releasing them the 
      access. </font> </li>

      <p align="justify">Due to the insecurity of Java byte-code, if you plan to

    redistributables may not be reverse engineered, decompiled, disassembled,
    nor placed for distribution, sale, or resale as individual creations by you
    or any individual not expressly given such permission by JIDE. The
    provision of source code, if included with the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, does not
    constitute transfer of any legal rights to such code, and resale or
    distribution of all or any portion of all source code and intellectual
    property will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of all applicable local,
    federal and international laws. All JIDE libraries, source code,

    of SOFTWARE PRODUCT (if any) or any other documents (such as javadoc) which 
    are intended to teach you how to use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, and sample code&nbsp;are not considered as redistributables. Subject to all of the terms 
    and conditions in this SLA, you may reproduce and distribute exact copies 
    of the Redistributables, provided that such copies are made from the 
    original copy of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT or the copy transferred to a hard 
    disk. Copies of Redistributables may only be distributed with and for the 
    sole purpose of executing application programs permitted under this SLA 
    that you have created using the SOFTWARE PRODUCT. 
    You may reformat or recombine the original distribution format of 
    redistributables provided by JIDE. However JIDE will not support or have any 
    liability for such use.
